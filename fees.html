                <h2>Payment tiers</h2>
                <p>There is no difference in the quality of services provided based on your payment tier. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The High Tier ($255-400) reflects the true cost of services. This tier helps us support ourselves, invest in continuing education, and increases our capacity for offering services to clients who may only commit to a lower fee. </li>
                    <li>The Middle Tier ($145-250) is a discounted rate which helps us pay bills and cover costs associated with operating a small business. </li>
                    <li>The Low Tier ($60-140) is our most deeply discounted rate, made possible through community support. As such, therapists have VERY limited capacity to offer these slots, depending on community investment.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>Sliding scale guidelines</h2>
